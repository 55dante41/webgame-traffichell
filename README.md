Traffic Hell - Arcade game built for Udacity Front-End developer Nano Degree
===============================

The Directory structure:
-css (directory to hold all stylesheets)
-fonts (directory to hold all font resources)
-images (directory to hold all image resources)
-js (directory to hold all scripts)
-index.html (main game file)
-readme.md (readme)

How to start the game:
The game can be started and played by simply opening 'index.html' in the main
directory with a browser (eg. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

index.html gets the necessary scripts from the 'js' directory to run the game.

How to play the game:
The main aim of the player is to survive in the traffic with highest possible
score. Hitting any of the nature traffic (bugs) or artificial traffic (cars)
resets the game. The player can gain score by collecting gems. Gems spawn
randomly all over the place and different colored gems have different value, so
it depends on the speed and luck of the player.

There is a safe zone on the bottom, where no traffic is present and no gems are
spawned. This is the best spot to land if you need to rest ;P

Controls:
UP arrow moves the player up
LEFT arrow moves the player left
RIGHT arrow moves the player right
DOWN arrow moves the player down

The game is hosted at "http://devmaestro.github.io/games/survive/index.html"
for anyone to play.
